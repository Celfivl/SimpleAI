Orange Chicken Recipe

Ingredients:

- 1.5 lbs boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into bite-sized pieces
- 1/2 cup cornstarch
- 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 2 tbsp vegetable oil
- 1/2 cup orange juice
- 1/4 cup soy sauce
- 2 tbsp rice vinegar
- 2 tbsp honey
- 1 tbsp brown sugar
- 1 tbsp orange zest
- 1 tsp ginger, grated
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes (optional)
- Cooked rice, for serving

Instructions:

1. In a bowl, combine cornstarch, flour, salt, and pepper. Dredge chicken pieces in the mixture, ensuring they are fully coated.
2. Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook until golden brown and cooked through, about 5-7 minutes. Remove chicken from skillet and set aside.
3. In the same skillet, combine orange juice, soy sauce, rice vinegar, honey, brown sugar, orange zest, ginger, garlic, and red pepper flakes (if using). Bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally.
4. Cook sauce until it thickens slightly, about 3-5 minutes.
5. Add cooked chicken to the skillet and toss to coat in the orange sauce.
6. Serve orange chicken over cooked rice. Garnish with green onions.
